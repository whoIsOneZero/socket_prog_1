# CLI chat app
![App Demo](app_demo.mp4)

## Description
- The messaging app is a command-line application designed for messaging between a socket client and a socket server. 

## How it works
It establishes a connection to a server running on a specified address and port, allowing the client to send and receive text messages, through the terminal.

## Testing
The app was deployed and tested on a local machine, and not with an actual remote server.
