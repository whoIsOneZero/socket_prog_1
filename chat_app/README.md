## Description
- The messaging app is a command-line client application designed for messaging between a user and a server. 

## How it works
It establishes a connection to a server running on a specified address and port, allowing users to send and receive text messages, through the terminal.

## Testing
The app was deployed and tested on a local machine, and not with an actual remote server.
